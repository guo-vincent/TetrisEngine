# HOW TO USE:

First, read the README and download the stuff that you need. You might want to do this outside of work though.

Assuming you have downloaded everything asked of you in the README, follow these steps.

in terminal/cmd prompt, while in root level of directory, run 
``` bash
python<version> build.py --run
```

That's it. You know how to run a python file.

Important files: 

/Tetris/TetrisEngine/include/TetrisEngine/Board.h and /Tetris/TetrisEngine/src/Board.cpp: 
- contains board class. Row 0 IS THE BOTTOM MOST ROW NOT THE TOP. Keep that in mind.
- think of it like (x,y) coordinate system; x = col, y = row, where (0, 0) is bottom left corner
- row major format. each jump in col is like jumping by 10 in terms of indices.
- contains info about current tetris blocks inputted in and ptr to current active piece
- other functions are pretty self explanatory/function is in the name
- all line clears are scored as 100 right now

/Tetris/TetrisEngine/include/TetrisEngine/Piece.h:
- contains definitions for all the pieces
- also pretty self explanatory
- Each Piece is defined in a 4 by 4 box, index 0 being top left corner. 

/Tetris/TetrisEngine/src/main.cpp:
- this is where everything is linked and executed
- currently only used to test that all the imports are working
- also has a working version of tetris without gravity

How to play the "game" in main (default tetrio/guidline controls): 
q - rotate piece counterclockwise
e - rotate piece clockwise
w - rotate piece 180
shift - hold piece
left - move piece left
right - move piece right
down - move piece down (one)
space - drop piece
esc - quit (unimplemented)

All other inputs are ignored.
